With these queries, I am querying a database within a RDBMS with multiple tables to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

/*How many many unique orders were placed in January?*/
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderID) AS numOrders 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6;


/*How many of those orders were for an iPhone?*/
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderID) AS numOrders 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = "iPhone" AND length(orderID) = 6;


/*Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.*/
SELECT DISTINCT customer.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS customer
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb
ON customer.order_id = feb.orderID
wHERE length(orderID) = 6;


/*Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?*/
SELECT Product AS cheapestProd, min(price) AS cheapestPrice
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;


/*What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?*/
SELECT Product, ROUND((sum(Quantity) * price), 2) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;


/*Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?*/
SELECT Product, sum(Quantity) AS quantity, ROUND((sum(Quantity) * price), 2) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY Product;


/*How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?*/
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer.acctnum) AS numCustomers, AVG(feb.Quantity * feb.price) AS avgSpent
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS customer
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb
ON customer.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND feb.Quantity > 2;

/*Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?*/
SELECT location, COUNT(orderID) AS numOrders

/*Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?*/
SELECT Product, sum(Quantity * price) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales

GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
