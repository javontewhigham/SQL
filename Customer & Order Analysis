With these queries, I am querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

/*How many many unique orders were placed in January?*/
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderID) AS numOrders 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6;


/*How many of those orders were for an iPhone?*/
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderID) AS numOrders 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = "iPhone" AND length(orderID) = 6;


/*Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.*/
SELECT DISTINCT customer.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS customer
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb
ON customer.order_id = feb.orderID
wHERE length(orderID) = 6;


/*Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?*/
SELECT Product AS cheapestProd, min(price) AS cheapestPrice
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;


/*What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?*/
SELECT Product, ROUND((sum(Quantity) * price), 2) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;


/*Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?*/
SELECT Product, sum(Quantity) AS quantity, ROUND((sum(Quantity) * price), 2) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY Product;


/*How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?*/
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer.acctnum) AS numCustomers, AVG(feb.Quantity * feb.price) AS avgSpent
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS customer
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb
ON customer.order_id = feb.orderID
wHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND feb.Quantity > 2


/*List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.*/
SELECT Product, sum(Quantity) AS numSold
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE "%Los Angeles%"
GROUP BY Product
